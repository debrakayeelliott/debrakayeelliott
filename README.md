### Hi :wave:,

I'm Debra-Kaye, front end developer, graphic designer and blogger. A lover of tech for many years, writing code seemed to be something only the "rocket scientists" of the world could do. After completing my Bachelor of Science Degree in Information Technology, Cum Laude at the University College of the Caribbean several years ago, I fell into the administrative and customer service fields, instead of tech as intended.

Fast-forward to years later and learning about web development, the path to tech became clearer. An active member of the developer community, I blog about my journey into tech and was featured as <a href="https://community.codenewbie.org/codenewbie/debra-kaye-elliott-the-go-getter-43mh" target="_blank">CodeNewbie's Community Spotlight Member for February 2021</a>.
